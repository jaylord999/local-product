Build a full-stack web application called **Local Product Finder**.

### Core Features

1. **Map View**

   * Use **Leaflet.js** with **OpenStreetMap** (or Google Maps API if easier).
   * Display pins for each store, using their logo as the pin icon.
   * Clicking a pin shows a popup with:

     * Store name + logo
     * Location & address
     * Sample product images + prices
   * Pins should highlight when the corresponding store is clicked in the list view.

2. **List View**

   * Card-style list of stores with:

     * Store name + logo
     * Distance from user (use geolocation API if possible)
     * Product thumbnails
     * Price ranges
   * Clicking a store highlights its pin on the map.
   * Users should be able to scroll through results easily.

3. **Toggle Between Views**

   * A simple toggle (buttons or switch) to change between **Map View** and **List View**.
   * Default to Map View but remember the user’s last choice.

4. **Filters**

   * Search bar for product category (e.g., “hardware,” “roof,” “eggs”).
   * Filter by **price range** (e.g., ₱200–₱500).
   * Filters should update both the map pins and the list results.

5. **Product Images**

   * Each store can upload product images (stored in DB).
   * Show thumbnail previews in list view and small previews in map popups.
   * Clicking an image should show a larger view.

6. **Interactivity**

   * Clicking store name in list zooms/highlights pin on map.
   * Clicking map pin scrolls/highlights the store in list.
   * Smooth transitions, no full page reloads.

### Data Models

  * `categories` (e.g., hardware, food, eggs)

* **Product**

  * `id`
  * `store_id`
  * `name`
  * `price`

**Goal:** Create a working prototype where users in Bohol can search for products (e.g., hardware, duck eggs, balut), filter by category and price, and either explore via **map** or **list view**. It should be **interactive, easy to use, and expandable globally**.
